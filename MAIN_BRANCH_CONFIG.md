# Main Branch Configuration Guide

## ✅ Current Status
Your repository is now fully configured to use `main` as the base branch!

## 🔧 What I've Configured

### **Local Git Configuration**
- ✅ Set `main` as global default branch for new repos
- ✅ Current repository is on `main` branch
- ✅ HEAD points to `refs/heads/main`
- ✅ Upstream tracking set to `origin/main`

### **GitHub Actions Workflow**
- ✅ Triggers on pushes to `main` branch
- ✅ Deploys only from `main` branch
- ✅ Pull requests target `main` branch

### **Repository Structure**
```
youtubeKids/
├── .github/workflows/deploy.yml  ✅ Uses main branch
├── main branch (current)         ✅ Active branch
└── origin/main                   ✅ Remote tracking
```

## 🌐 GitHub Repository Settings

To complete the setup, ensure GitHub uses `main` as default:

### **Step 1: Check Current Default**
1. Go to: https://github.com/yasir0722/youtubeKids
2. Look at the branch dropdown (should show `main`)

### **Step 2: Set as Default (if needed)**
1. Click **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **Default branch** section
3. Click **Switch to another branch** if not already `main`
4. Select **main** and click **Update**

## 🚀 Benefits of Main as Base Branch

### **Development Workflow**
- ✅ New clones start on `main`
- ✅ Pull requests default to `main`
- ✅ Releases tagged from `main`

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
- ✅ GitHub Actions deploy from `main`
- ✅ GitHub Pages serves from `main`
- ✅ Automatic deployments on push

### **Team Collaboration**
